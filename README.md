<h1>Diet unmasks hidden susceptibility in complex traits</h1>
<p></p>
<br>This repository hosts scripts used for investigating Gene-Diet interation for advance intercross line in complex traits. <br>The advance intercross line consists of four-way cross between BxD2/TyJ, CAST/EiJ, NZM2410/J and MRL/MpJ mouse strain for 15-20 generations.</br>
<p>The raw data used in the analysis is deposited in:</p>
<p>ENA (whole genome sequencing FastQ file for 3 out of 4 strain. Note CAST/EIJ whole genome sequencing data can be obtained from ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1807-SNPs_Indels/)</p>
<p>DRYAD database (raw plink genotype data and VCF file for whole genome sequencing)<p> and 
<p>NCBI SRA (RNAseq, Microbiome [V1-V2] and Mycobiome [ITS2], raw FastQ files).</p>
